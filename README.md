# ImageToAscii

Choose images to convert to Ascii! It will look something like this (this is just some random image):

It obviously outputs Ascii so you can copy and paste, not a png. The color is also just an artifact of zooming  
out in the console, if you zoom back in it becomes the normal text color.  
  
The amount of available characters, and therefore color range can be easily modified, but lower amount of characters  
gives better constrast which if found preferable. Output size can also be easily modified.
