# ImageToAscii

Choose images to convert to Ascii! It will look something like this (this is just some random image):

It obviously outputs Ascii so you can copy and paste, not a png. The color is also just an artifact of zooming  
out in the console, if you zoom back in it becomes the normal text color.
